# 📚 Student Management System (Java, OOP Project)

A simple yet powerful **console-based Student Management System** built using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student records with file-based data storage for persistence.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Add Student  
Enter student details like ID, name, age, course, and marks.

### ✔ View All Students  
Displays all saved student records in a clean format.

### ✔ Search by ID  
Find a student using their unique ID.

### ✔ Update Student  
Modify individual student fields (name, age, course, marks).

### ✔ Delete Student  
Remove a student permanently based on ID.

### ✔ File Handling  
All student records are stored in `students.txt` so data is available even after program exit.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

This project follows key Object-Oriented Programming principles:

### ✔ **Encapsulation**  
Each student is represented by a `Student` class with private fields and public getters/setters.

### ✔ **Abstraction**  
`StudentManager` class handles all student-related operations.

### ✔ **Polymorphism**  
Method overriding (`toString()`) for displaying student details.

### ✔ **Modularity / Class-based Structure**  
Clean separation of responsibilities across:

- `Student.java`
- `StudentManager.java`
- `Main.java`
